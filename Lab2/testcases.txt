layout is correct

Screen starts with 0
numbers add the appropriate number to the screen
no leading zeros except for decimals points (0.5)
no more than 1 decimal point
Clear button resets the screen to 0 and clears the operations and stored values

operators all do correct calculations (1+1 = 2 etc)
current running result is displayed on screen after hitting an operator but before entering another number
= button shows the running result, buts does not clear running result
plus minus button changes the sign of the number on screen, can be pressed any number of times in a row
hitting operators more than once in a row does nothing
hitting = more than once in a row does nothing
typing after hitting = clears the screen and starts a new calculation
hitting an operator after hitting = contiues the calculation with the result of the previous calculation
